# For what?
Mainly for me, but if someone is interested, there are my dotfiles :)

# Intallation (for arch only)

First copy this repo to your home directory

``` git clone https://github.com/danihek/dotfiles ```

Then there's a script for automatic installation of all dependecies and configurations of my workpace. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK, I created this mainly for me and my new setups:

``` ./install.sh ```
